# Home control panel

This is a simple application that communicates with an aurduino UNO via an x-bee module.
Through the GUI, the user is able to send commands to the arduino but also is able to 
register his e-mail and send commands to the arduino via e-mail. 

Must point out that this application is the first complete application that i have created thus
don't be judgemental :P The only thing that i have changed is the structure of the project and
the README file.


This is the provided GUI:
