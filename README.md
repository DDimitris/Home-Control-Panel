# Home control panel

This is a simple application that communicates with an Arduino UNO via an X-Bee module or a USB port.
With the provided GUI, the user is able to send commands to the Arduino but also is able to 
register his e-mail address (this feature only works with gmail addresses) and send commands to the Arduino via e-mail. 

### Important note:
The user must install the RXTX library into his system in order for this application to be able to 
communicate with the arduino. Installation notes can be found here: http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Installation

##### Disclaimer
Must point out that this application is the first complete application that i have created thus
don't be judgemental :P The only thing that i have changed is the structure of the project and
the README file.


This is a screenshot of the provided GUI:
